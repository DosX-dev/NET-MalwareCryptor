# NET-MalwareCryptor
.NET MalwareCryptor is an open-source malware packer utility. It is intended for educational purposes only and strictly prohibits the use of its code for any illegal activities.

This free tool is designed to encrypt malware samples using a modified base64 encoding algorithm. It adds random garbage data to the encrypted payload, further complicating its analysis.

To utilize the utility, simply execute the following command:
 * net-cryptengine example.exe

For enhanced effectiveness, it is strongly recommended to heavily obfuscate the assembly before applying the encryption process.
